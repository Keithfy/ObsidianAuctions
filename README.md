# How to file a bug report
Please post all relevant stacktraces to either [pastebin.com](pastebin.com) or [hastebin.com](hastebin.com).
Provide as much detail as possible to resolve the bug the fastest.
If you have any programming experience if you could take a look at the code and see if you can find the possible fix it would be appreciated, as the project is just maintained by myself virustotalop and contributions code or otherwise are very much appreciated.

# How to submit a pull request
Make a fork of master and submit a pull request into the refactor branch making sure that the code compiles against spigot 1.8+.
If any of the code does not compile the pull request will either be rejected or you will be asked to update the code.
For any new classes follow the [allman style of formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) other classes follow the style that is there as a majority of the code needs to be refactored into allman anyways. Make sure to sign the [contributors file](CONTRIBUTORS.md) when you submit the pull request. Need help with markdown?

# FAQ
* What is ObsidianAuctions?
 * Obsidian auctions is a fork of FloAuctions an auction plugin that was originally being used for my server [ClubObsidian](www.clubobsidian.com). I forked the plugin because I liked it, there was a bug and the maintainer was inactive.
* I have a bug can you fix it?
  * File an issue and I'll see what I can do refer to above to see how to file a bug report.
* I have a feature can you put it in?
  * It depends on the complexity and if I have time to complete it. If I don't think it fits with the vision of ObsidianAuctions I will reject it. You may however fork this project and add it yourself. Alternatively if its a feature I don't have time to implement it I welcome pull requests.
